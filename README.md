Abstract:
Inspired by works that included the use of Motion Capture for human body movement estimation, authors have created a program to test the correct performance of sword fencing in terms of combat sports, more specifically, the Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA). The focus is on the analysis of four actors, only one of them is a professional fencer. Each made the same motions that were recorded by the MoCap system to determine the pattern of the correct cut and show the mistakes made by amateurs.
